      <h2>Glossary of Windstorm Terms</h2>
      <p>Below you will find definitions and explanations of common terms used when discussing windstorms.</p>

      <dl class="glossary-list">
        <dt>Windstorm</dt>
        <dd>A storm with very strong winds but little or no rain, strong enough to cause damage. (Source: Wikipedia)</dd>

        <dt>Extratropical Cyclone</dt>
        <dd>A low-pressure weather system that forms outside the tropics and is associated with strong winds and frontal boundaries. These are the systems that produce most European windstorms. (Source: Wikipedia)</dd>

        <dt>Jet Stream</dt>
        <dd>A fast-flowing air current in the upper atmosphere that influences storm development and movement across Europe. (Source: Wikipedia)</dd>

        <dt>Pressure Gradient</dt>
        <dd>The rate of pressure change between two locations. A steeper gradient means stronger winds. (Source: Britannica)</dd>

        <dt>Gale</dt>
        <dd>A wind with speeds between 62–74 km/h (39–46 mph) on the Beaufort scale. Often associated with strong low-pressure systems. (Source: Wikipedia)</dd>

        <dt>Sting Jet</dt>
        <dd>A sting jet is a narrow, transient and mesoscale airstream that descends from the mid-troposphere to the surface in some extratropical cyclones.
          When present, sting jets produce some of the strongest surface-level winds in extratropical cyclones and can generate damaging wind gusts in excess
          of 50 m/s (180 km/h; 110 mph). (Source: Wikipedia)</dd>

        <dt>Barometric Pressure</dt>
        <dd>The pressure of the atmosphere as indicated by a barometer (Source: NWS)</dd>

        <dt>Storm Surge</dt>
        <dd>A rise in sea level caused by strong winds and low pressure from a storm pushing water toward the coast. (Source: NOAA)</dd>

        <dt>Wind Gust</dt>
        <dd>A wind gust or just gust is a brief, sudden increase in the wind speed. It usually lasts for less than 20 seconds, briefer than a squall, which
          lasts minutes. A gust is followed by a lull (or slackening) in the wind speed. Generally, winds are least gusty over large water surfaces and most 
          gusty over rough land and near high buildings. (Source: Wikipedia)</dd>

        <dt>Wind Speed</dt>
        <dd>In meteorology, wind speed, or wind flow speed, is a fundamental atmospheric quantity caused by air moving from high to low pressure, usually 
        due to changes in temperature. Wind speed is now commonly measured with an anemometer (Source: Wikipedia)</dd>

        <dt>Cyclogenesis</dt>
        <dd>The formation or intensification of a cyclone or low-pressure storm system. (Source: NWS)</dd>

        <dt>Explosive Cyclogenesis</dt>
        <dd>Explosive cyclogenesis (also referred to as a weather bomb, meteorological bomb, explosive development, bomb cyclone, or bombogenesis) is the rapid
        deepening of an extratropical cyclonic low-pressure area. The change in pressure needed to classify something as explosive cyclogenesis is latitude dependent.
        For example, at 60° latitude, explosive cyclogenesis occurs if the central pressure decreases by 24 millibars (0.71 inHg) or more in 24 hours. Although their
        cyclogenesis is entirely different from that of tropical cyclones, bomb cyclones can produce winds of 74 to 95 mph (120 to 155 km/h), the same order as the first
        categories of the Saffir-Simpson scale, and yield heavy precipitation. Even though only a minority of bomb cyclones become this strong, some weaker ones can
        also cause significant damage. (Source: Wikipedia)</dd>

        <dt>Saffir-Simpson scale</dt>
        <dd>The Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS) is a tropical cyclone intensity scale that classifies hurricanes-which in the Western Hemisphere are
        tropical cyclones that exceed the intensities of tropical depressions and tropical storms-into five categories distinguished by the intensities of their
        sustained winds.
        <dt>Occluded Front</dt>
        <dd>A weather front formed when a cold front overtakes a warm front, common in mature extratropical cyclones. (Source: Met Office)</dd>

        <dt>Anticyclone</dt>
        <dd>A high-pressure system associated with calm, clear weather and light winds. (Source: Wikipedia)</dd>

        <dt>Synoptic Chart</dt>
        <dd>A weather map showing pressure systems, fronts, and weather observations at a specific time. (Source: Met Office)</dd>
